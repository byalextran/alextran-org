I’ve always had a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to accountability relationships. I cringe and sigh anytime I’ve been in groups which require an accountability partner.

Not that I don’t believe in it’s value (I do). The bad taste comes from never having a fruitful, long-term accountability pairing. From feeling like any attempt is doomed to failure.

As I’ve been pondering why that is, I believe one shortcoming has been the focus/topic of discussion. In the past, most of the dialogue and accountability has been on overcoming sin. You get together, talk about what you struggle with and how you can “do better.”

The focus has always been on sin.

But the question I’ve been asking myself is: what helps my relationship with God more?

Does my relationship with God deepen more through overcoming sin or through other ways?

I believe this verse in John 15 sums it up best.

> **John 15:5 (NIV)**  
> 5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.

We bear fruit when we remain close to the vine. In other words, growth happens when our relationship with Jesus is thriving.

And that should be the focus of any accountability relationship; ensuring each person is connected to the vine.

What questions would you ask yourself to keep your relationship with God in check?
