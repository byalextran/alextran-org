I did some minor housekeeping with the email and RSS links used to subscribe to this blog.

If you’re not subscribed, why not [click here](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=tranified/alextran&loc=en_US) to subscribe via email? You’ll get emails whenever I make a new post. No need to manually check the site. Just kick back, relax and let me do all the work. ;) And you can unsubscribe at any time.

For those familiar with RSS, you can add [this feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/tranified/alextran).

_You will have to re-subscribe if you were already getting email notifications_.

I know. Big fat fail on my part for making you do more work. Sorry!
