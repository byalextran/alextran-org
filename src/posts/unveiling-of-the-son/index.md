> **2 Corinthians 3:14-16 (NIV)**  
> 14 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.

I was at the beach last Wednesday praying with some friends.  We were early enough to see the sun rise above the horizon.  But as we finished our prayer, the sun was covered by clouds. One of my friends later pointed out no matter how much the sun is covered, it’s existence and impact on this world is undeniable. The same goes with God and his two sidekicks.  ;)

The analogy made me think about the verse above.  It’s been the verse that has been with me throughout most of this year’s [season of prayer and fasting](http://www.awake21.org/).

We live lives veiled with unbelief, fear or contentment.  Laziness, selfishness.  Pride.  Our minds are dull to the things of God (v14).  The power, confidence and fruit of God’s love are all missing from our lives.  Our vision is limited to the dense fog surrounding us.  There’s no eternal perspective.  There’s no clarity of vision of Jesus Christ himself.

What are we looking at?  Are we focusing our eyes on the veil two inches in front of us?  Or are we looking past what’s directly in front of us towards Jesus and the promise that if we turn to him, the veil will be taken away?

I can already anticipate the feeling of warmth as the sun emerges past the clouds and our lives become unveiled.
