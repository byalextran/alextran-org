My goal with this site is to share as much valuable content as possible. I do it because I love running, learning, teaching, and writing. PowerPacing.Run gives me an outlet to do all four of those things.

So the primary motivation (by far) is writing genuinely useful stuff.

However, occasionally I'll write things that provide an opportunity to link to Amazon or other brands I might have an affiliate relationship with. That means if you buy a product or service through those links, I'll get some type of commission.

You should assume any links to products or services are affiliate links.

You should also know integrity is a core value of mine.

That means I'll only use affiliate links for products or services I've used personally _and_ extensively enough to recommend. It's safe to say I'll only link to products or services I think you'll find helpful.

If you have any questions, please hit me up on my [Contact page](https://www.alextran.org/contact/).
