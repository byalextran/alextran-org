Here’s some more quote lovin’ from Andy Stanley in [_Communicating for a Change_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590525140?ie=UTF8&tag=shr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590525140).

> … spiritual maturity is gauged by application not contemplation. James says it best, “Faith without deeds is useless. (James 2:20)” “Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. (James 1:22)”

### Application

> When asked which of the commandments were the greatest He summarized the entire law with two action-oriented imperatives, love God and love your neighbor.

### Not Contemplation

> It’s interesting that the group who knew the Old Testament Scriptures best were the very ones who considered Jesus a blasphemer and arranged for His crucifixion.
