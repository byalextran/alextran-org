> **Isaiah 49:4 (NIV)**  
> But I said, “I have labored in vain;  
> I have spent my strength for nothing at all.  
> Yet what is due me is in the LORD’s hand,  
> and my reward is with my God.”

> **Romans 14:8 (NIV)**  
> If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
