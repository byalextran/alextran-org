Wow. It’s only the third day of the fast and I am S-T-ruggling.

My faith has taken a big hit. My confidence has started to crumble slightly. All the good vibrations from Day 1 are more like loud, rattles from a soon to be broken muffler. Heh.

> Our God is greater, our God is stronger  
> God You are higher than any other  
> Our God is Healer, awesome in power  
> Our God, Our God  
> …  
> And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us  
> And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?  
> And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us  
> And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?

The good news? The lyrics above are money. They are encouraging. It was one of the songs I heard this morning during my worship time.

It’s funny how you can be on cloud 9 one second; super confident and full of faith in what God is doing only to start questioning days later. I can totally understand the waves crashing back and forth analogy in James.

> **James 1:6-7 (NIV)**  
> 6 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 7 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.

The first day [I reminded myself](https://www.alextran.org/2011/01/10/dont-be-afraid-to-ask/) (and you) not be afraid to ask God.

Today, I’m telling myself to continue believing in faith despite the ups and downs I’ve been experiencing. It’s easy to tell yourself you didn’t hear from God correctly. Or it just wasn’t meant to be.

But screw that junk! \*[cue Rocky theme song](http://tinysong.com/i09L)\*

Just as we have to constantly fight to guard our relationship with God, we have to fight just as hard to believe and not doubt. The things I’m praying and believing God are important to me. Important enough not to abandon ship in the first few days. ;)

And really, the only way I know how stir up faith when it’s dwindling is to press in to God. To kick it up a notch. Go deeper, seek harder, believe bigger.

To quote a good friend:

> did you think it was going to be easy? its a battle! WIN IT!

So, what’s the report from everyone on Day 3? I’m hoping everyone is still on cloud 9. But if not, what are some challenges you’re running into?
