Below is an essay written by Brooke Bronkowski, a girl I read about in _[Crazy Love](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1434768511?ie=UTF8&tag=shr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1434768511)_ by [Francis Chan](http://www.cornerstonesimi.com/).

The essay was written at the age of twelve and is a humbling expression of maturity from from a girl who later passed away in a car accident (at the age of fourteen).

### Since I Have My Life Before Me

I’ll live my life to the fullest. I’ll be happy. I’ll brighten up. I will be more joyful than I have ever been. I will be kind to others. I will loosen up. I will tell others about Christ. I will go on adventures and change the world. I will be bold and not change who I really am. I will have no troubles but instead help others with their troubles.

You see, I’ll be one of those people who live to be history makers at a young age. Oh, I’ll have moments, good and bad, but I will wipe away the bad and only remember the good. In fact that’s all I remember, just good moments, nothing in between, just living my life to the fullest. I’ll be one of those people who go somewhere with a mission, an awesome plan, a world-changing plan, and nothing will hold me back. I’ll set an example for others, I will pray for direction.

I have my life before me. I will give others the joy I have and God will give me more joy. I will do everything God tells me to do. I will follow the footsteps of God. I will do my best!!!
