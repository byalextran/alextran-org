Let’s play a word association game. What’s the first thing that comes to mind when I say the following words/phrases.

-   Hipster
-   Netflix
-   Full-time ministry

My answers would be: skinny jeans, binge watching and working at a church.

Since I work at a church, people often ask me what it’s like to be in full-time ministry.

I _hate_ this question.

It implies I’m in full-time ministry and you are not. Here’s the truth. If you’re a Christian, you are in full-time ministry.

So how about _you_ tell me, what’s it like being in full-time ministry? What are ways we can all have that mindset each day?
