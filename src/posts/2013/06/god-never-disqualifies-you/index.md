Do you believe that? Or do your insecurities, doubts or fears get in the way of truly believing?

What gets in the your way?

Sometimes I think about my current career path. I spent the better part of nine years as a software developer/web guy. But now I’m a small groups pastor. I went from being a web developer to a people developer. I have no clue what I’m doing. I’m experience growing pains as a leader in a role that requires a completely different set of skills.

And I’ve been in a dry season with God. How can I pastor and lead people when I feel disconnected from God?

I’d like to disqualify myself at times.

But God never does.

> **Galatians 1:13**  
> 13 For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.

This was the Apostle Paul. In his previous way of life he intensely persecuted the church. He stood by and watched Christians get executed; nodding in approval.

> **Galatians 1:22-24**  
> 22 I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 23 They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” 24 _And they praised God because of me_.

Despite the man Paul used to be, he was able to say “and they praised God because of me.”

God works through broken people. ([click to tweet this](http://clicktotweet.com/7bedA).)

People who have committed adultery. Lashed out in anger. Said hateful things to loved ones. He works through our doubts, insecurities and fear. When we don’t think we’re good enough, God says we are.

We have been set apart and called by his grace…all for Him.

> **Galatians 1:15**  
> 15 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace…

It’s not what you’ve done. It’s who you are; a child of God created in His image.

And even though we may be nobody’s in our own eyes, if we embrace our weaknesses and imperfections, God’s transforming power can come alive in us.

And people will praise God because of you.

Talk to me in the comments. What are some things that have made you feel unable to be used by God?
