### Passion is Not a Job or Obligation

-   You’ll go further on fumes of passion than one million dollars.

-   With passion, you’ll get more buy in from people and volunteers.

-   At this level, no one is going to stir passion up for you.
    -   Got to learn to do it on your own.

-   Need a gut-level gladness.

-   Passion is a heart issue. It is internally regulated.
    -   Colossians 3:23
    -   If the heart is established, it cannot be shaken.
        -   Only things that can be shaken will be.

### It’s About the Bigger Picture

-   Not about position in church.
    -   Instead a “whatever attitude.” In it for the bigger picture.

-   Constantly keep bigger picture in mind. Constantly die to self.

### Don’t Live a Compartmentalized Life

This point is related to how do you juggle so many things at one time. If you’re involved in full-time ministry, sometimes it’s hard to separate “church life” from “home life.” Christine touches on this point; saying not to view your life as compartmentalized.

-   Your life isn’t compartmentalized (e.g. church life, spouse life, extracurricular life, etc.), it’s interconnected.

-   There’s no conflict when your heart is established (interconnected, not compartmentalized).
    -   You are not taking away from one or the other.

-   You don’t have multiple lives (e.g. church, spouse, friend). You have one life.
    -   A life in Christ. Everything orbits around that.

-   Don’t build extraordinary churches on ordinary commitment.

### You Lose Passion When . . .

Brian Houston reminds the staff at Hillsong that he would take passion, an attitude of gratitude and submission over gifts and talents any day.

-   Get bored.
    -   You forget your first love (Revelation 2:4).
    -   You think it’s all about you and not the bigger picture.

-   Isolate yourself or become lonely.

-   Insecure
    -   In a church that ebbs and flows, your ability to be flexible and navigate those ebbs determines your longevity on the team.
    -   Lots of people leave because of insecurity; they’re not getting the spotlight.
        -   Equivalent of an adolescent temper tantrum.
    -   Stay secure in Christ.

-   Laziness
    -   Psalm 127:1
    -   There’s always work involved in building God’s house.

-   Procrastination

-   Lust
    -   Desire to have something that’s not yours to have (now or ever).
    -   Keep eyes in your own lane.
