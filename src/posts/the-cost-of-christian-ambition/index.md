I read an article a few weeks ago. It asks the question: [Can you be a “great man” or “great woman” without being a butt-hole?](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/can-you-be-a-great-man/) Or is being a jerk a necessary quality to achieve greatness?

The saying goes: “if I say yes to this, it means I say no to that.”

To accomplish something significant means you will sacrifice many things. More often than not that’s health, happiness and the relationships closest to you (i.e. spouse, family, friends).

It got me thinking.

What do Christians sacrifice to do something great for God?

Name a project, idea, ministry, initiative, etc. you want to do for God. Is it negatively impacting your life? Is it hindering your personal time with Jesus?

Is it worth it?

Is it worth being stressed all the time? Is it worth not being there for your spouse/family? Is it worth being depressed and having no energy?

The focus of our ambition and desire should not be on our influence or accomplishment but on having a deep, meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ.

I’m beginning to define greatness as not how much you do or how high you build for God, but how much you know the Father and he knows you.
