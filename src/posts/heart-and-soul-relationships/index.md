> **1 Samuel 14:6-7 (NIV)**  
> 6 Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.”
> 
> 7 “Do all that you have in mind,” **_his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”_**

They follow you into battle.

> **Exodus 17:11-12 (NIV)**  
> 11 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 12 When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. **_Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset._**

They support you when you get tired.

> **1 Samuel 20:4 (NIV)**  
> 4 Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”

They “do” . . . no questions asked.

> **Daniel 3:16-18 (NIV)**  
> 16 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. 17 **_If we are thrown into the blazing furnace_**, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand. 18 But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”

They will stand with you in the midst of persecution, trials and temptations.

> **Ruth 1:16 (NIV)**  
> 16 But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.

They are always by your side.

> **John 15:13 (NIV)**  
> 13 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
> 
> **Romans 5:8 (NIV)**  
> 8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, **_Christ died for us_**.

They would die for you.
