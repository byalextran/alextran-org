Sometimes in our quest for knowledge and answers, we explain God away and sideline him.  Moving mountains and earthquakes (v5-6) are understood by [fault lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_fault).  Science (and Wikipedia!) give us all the answers.  [The Bear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major), [Orion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(constellation\)) and [Pleiades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_\(star_cluster\)) (v9) have their own Wikipedia article telling us everything we ever wanted to know about each constellation and its history.

But don’t forget how big and amazingly creative our God is. He is the creator of all the things that can be described, dissected and analyzed until we have all the answers.

What if you read these Wikipedia articles and instead of knowing them to be written by educated scientists in the field, you viewed them as written by God?

In a society of smart people, that is the one thing we \_can’t\_ forget.

> Those are yours.

> I want to be able to smile from ear to ear when I see and experience your creation knowing you placed them there.
> 
> I want to forget adult etiquette and tell strangers how “awesome” and “cool” you are because you created the large and in charge banana spider by my mailbox.

> For some reason God, I just want to have a grin on my face thinking about all this.

I laugh in the face of science! Hah!
