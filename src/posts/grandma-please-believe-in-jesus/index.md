A few years ago I found out my unsaved grandma was about to die. Unfortunately, my Chinese was not up to par, so I couldn’t say what I wanted to say to her. Instead, I wrote a letter and had my aunt read/translate it to my grandma.

The purpose of the letter was to tell her about Jesus. I don’t know why, but I felt like digging it up and sharing it.

And I wish I could tell you there was a happy ending, but there wasn’t.

It’s okay though. Through it all, I came to understand Jesus still sits on the throne in situations like these.

### The Letter

Dear Grandma,

I want to write you a letter and tell you how much I love you. You’ve  
always been very close to my heart even though we’ve been separated for  
awhile. For the longest time you were a mom to me, making sure we got  
up for school and taking care of us when we were sick.

I remember when I was younger I would wake up in the mornings and lay in  
bed for a few minutes. Then I’d yell “Grandma!!” and wait for you to  
answer. Once you answered, I’d be satisfied and get out of bed. If you  
didn’t answer, I’d keep yelling and yelling until you would. Sometimes  
I’d even start crying until you answered. I didn’t want to talk to you  
or anything; I just wanted to know you were still around and close to  
me. It made me happy to know you were.

I love you. I want you to know that if I could, I would take your  
sickness on me. I would even trade places with you and die so that you  
could live instead of me. I never understood that kind of love until  
someone did the same for me. Someone died for me. And now I want you  
to understand that kind of love. Listen to me now because I would give  
my life to _anyone_ if only they’d believe and understand what I’m about  
to say.

The man who traded his life for mine was Jesus Christ. To him I owe  
everything. I owe him my life and my complete devotion. He’s done so  
much that I have to share it with you so that you have a chance to love  
Jesus as much as I do. Jesus lived awhile ago and spent his life  
sharing God’s promises. These promises eventually led people to kill  
Jesus because they were afraid of him. Jesus could have run away and  
avoided dying, but he let the people kill him because He wanted everyone  
to know how much he was willing to sacrifice for us. He wanted to show  
us his love for us.

Even though Jesus died, three days later God raised him from the dead so  
that we could experience God’s promise. That promise is that if we  
believe Jesus was the Son of God and that God raised him from the dead,  
then we can also be raised from the dead when we die. Everyone who  
believes will be able to live forever in Heaven with Jesus and everyone  
else who believes. But only if you believe Jesus died for you.

Grandma, that’s what I want for you. I cry at night when I pray for you  
that you would understand this because it would hurt me so much to call  
your name in Heaven and have you not there to answer. This is important  
to me.

So Grandma, know that Jesus loves you. He traded his life for yours as  
well as mine. Jesus wants to see you in Heaven. I want to see you in  
Heaven. All you have to do is believe in your heart that what I just  
told you about Jesus is true. I know it is because I’ve believed in  
Jesus for five years now and Jesus has revealed himself to me, letting  
me know He’s still alive and in Heaven waiting for me.

I pray that you would understand all that I just said. I pray that God  
will heal you so that you have more time to live and let Jesus reveal  
himself to you as well.

I love you Grandma,
