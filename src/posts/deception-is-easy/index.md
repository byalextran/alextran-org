This past week (on the 18th), I celebrated my 11 year spiritual birthday.

The scary thing about that milestone . . . I believe I have reached a lethal level of understanding of the Christian faith.

One that would let me fake Christian maturity.

Surprisingly, that’s what’s come to mind as I’ve reflected on the past 11 years.

You get to a level where you can operate on cruise control despite a flailing relationship with God. You could be working at a church, leading a Bible study, talking with your accountability partner and nobody would know the difference.

You know all the right answers.

Moral of the story?

The further you walk with Jesus, the harder you have to fight to keep your relationship real and authentic.
