As with most things, it’s easy to say “[I want to make disciples](/it-only-took-30-years-but-i-have-one/),” but much harder to do.

On a practical level, what does that really mean?

> **Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)**
> 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. \[…\]”

Here we have the main “make disciples” verse. From v20, we can extract three key areas.

-   Knowing
-   Obeying
-   Teaching

### Knowing

First off, you can’t teach jack squat if you don’t know anything about what you’re teaching. To teach God’s commandments, we have to know them. That means eating, drinking and farting the Bible.

It’s the single greatest physical tool God has given us. Take advantage of it.

[Memorizing some Bible verses](/6-sources-for-weekly-bible-memory-verses/) is a good place to start.

### Obeying

It’s one thing to know the Bible and have sound doctrine/theology. But ultimately, knowledge (by itself) puffs up. The true desire of God’s heart is that our knowledge would lead to obedience (action).

So as we strive to know the Word, we also need to be very intentional about obeying it.

### Teaching

Knowledge has to be shared. God’s Word has to be taught.

The discipleship process doesn’t continue, doesn’t multiple, doesn’t have it’s greatest impact without imparting our collective wisdom to the next generation.

We have to teach people the value of discipleship. The value of God’s Word. The value of obedience. And the power of living a God-first life.

Those three things (knowing, obeying and teaching) are the marks of a disciple.
