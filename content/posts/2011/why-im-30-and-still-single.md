So, in March I’m turning 30.

Which I guess is a milestone year for a lot of people. It’s got me thinking about a lot of things. Tonight, while I couldn’t sleep (because yet again I drank way too much Coke this late at night), I found myself pondering my singleness.

Over the course of time, my “spouse filter” has slowly dwindled to just two, bare essential requirements.

1.  Spiritually attractive
2.  Physically attractive

The list reminds me of [Othello’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) tagline: a minute to learn, a lifetime to master. Or in this case, easy to say, a lifetime to find. ;)

This post is really about #1 and why it’s so mission critical to me.

### Spiritually Attractive

The main reason is I know life brings with it many trials and tribulations. Inevitably we all face challenges. In a marriage, I’m confident many of those will come from the marriage relationship itself.

What I know about a grounded, Jesus-lovin’ woman is that despite the roller coaster ups and downs, their inward life remains constant and steady.

-   They are internally regulated by their faith in Jesus Christ.
-   They understand the concept of dying to self and being selfless.
-   They are willing to do the God thing which may not always be the easy thing.

This is the type of woman I want to be with. This is the type of woman I know will go the distance through sickness and health. Where I don’t ever have to second guess the integrity of her character or devotion to God.

A woman who will actually put more fear in Satan knowing we’re together than each of us did individually.

### Physically Attractive

I guess I’ll touch on this real quickly. Even though it’s secondary to me, it’s still important. ;)

If I don’t look at you and have a strong desire to suck your face, make out on the couch and have some babies along the way then it’s just not going to work…

Just sayin’. ;)

### Oh, to Answer the Question

I’m still single because while there are a lot of attractive woman in the world, spiritual attractiveness is much harder to come by. Good looks will only tempt me for a second. ;)

But surprisingly as I approach 30, I’m not worried. I don’t feel rushed. A wife of that caliber is worth waiting for.

People may say my standards are too high. I would agree. They need to be.

Marriage has _always_ been a lifetime commitment for me. It wigs me out why some people spend more time choosing the right big screen TV than they do choosing their spouse.

This is a lifetime decision people! Take it seriously!

It’s a much bigger deal than choosing the best big screen TV. We need to put a lot more thought and prayer into it.

What are your thoughts? Am I crazy? Disagree? Let me know in the comments.
