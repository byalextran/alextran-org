Regardless if you get your recommended daily amount of sleep, you can still wake up refreshed, but feel tired and overwhelmed.

> **2 Kings 6:15-17 (NIV)**  
> 15 When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh, my lord, what shall we do?” the servant asked.
> 
> 16 “Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “**Those who are with us are more than those who are with them**.”
> 
> 17 And Elisha prayed, “O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.” Then the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and **he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire** all around Elisha.

This is not a post about “you and God are always a majority.” This is a post of appreciation.

The past month of my life have been a roller coaster ride spiritually, relationally, professionally and everything in between. God has literally wrecked me, humbled me and broken me into millions of little pieces.  And believe it or not, those are all good things.  ;)

But I could not have survived the stress of this past month without certain people in my life.

**[Nate](http://www.natehuebner.org/)** and **[Danielle](http://danniwrites.wordpress.com/)** who brilliantly led and executed a small group for the month of July.  A group I normally co-lead with someone else.

**Dawn**.  A willing and able servant who has freed me up to do what only I can do.  You have been an \_amazing\_ blessing.  You have no idea how much peace you bring me with the stuff you do.

**Ferdie**.  Without you, I would be dead.  Straight up.  Thank you for your creativity, passion for the end-user experience, flexibility, sacrifice and patience with crazy time lines.  You truly are an answer to prayer. By golly, we will have a rockin’ website one of these days . . .

**[Sarah](http://thebyrdsnest.wordpress.com/)**.  My #1 draft pick.  ;)  Someone I would want on any team, regardless of what the team was for.  Thank you for eagerly coming alongside me and bearing some of the \_my\_ burdens on top of your own (e.g. a husband and a couple little rugrats).

When I read the above verses, these are the people I’m reminded of when Elisha says “those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”  When I wake up and am already tired, it’s these people who have allowed me to overcome the army surrounding me.

I look up and each person is surrounded by “horses and chariots.”  Each one has brought to the table way more than what can be seen in the natural.

To all of you guys, thank you!!  All of you guys/gals have significantly contributed to me surviving July.  ;)

Today’s challenge to greatness.  Tell someone how much you appreciate them.
