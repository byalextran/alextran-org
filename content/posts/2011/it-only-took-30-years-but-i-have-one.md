And no, [it’s not a wife](/why-im-30-and-still-single/). ;)

This past year has been extremely eye-opening to me. God has taught me a lot about myself. What I love, what I hate, who I am. But more importantly, provided clarity to my life’s mission/message.

More or less the one thing I want to devote my life to.

And that is making disciples of Jesus Christ.

### Can You Be Any More Generic, Alex?

Fair enough. ;) Let me go a little deeper on how that applies to me and make it worthy of being my life’s mission!

The Great Commission sums it up nicely.

> **Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)**
> 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations . . . 20 teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you . . .

But it’s more than just a verse. It is me. Making disciples is how God has made _me_.

God definitely didn’t make me to evangelize and get thousands saved. Or to preach from the pulpit. Or have huge vision and light fires under people.

When God knit me in my mother’s womb and gave me the gifts and passions he did, I’m confident discipleship is what he had in mind for me. That is how God wanted me to serve him and advance his kingdom.

It is where my greatest eternal impact will be.

And _that_ is the biggest revelation of this past year. Quite possibly my entire lifetime. ;)

### If I Accomplish Nothing Else…

To quote the lyrics from a "[After the Music Stops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNBpjBE6ew8)" by Lecrae, if I accomplish nothing else but “take the Bible, create disciples, who make disciples, disciple-cycles” then I will be content knowing I have faithfully served God.

In short, I will die with a smile on my face. ;)

I’ll have a deep sense of accomplishment knowing I’ve left an eternal legacy that will continue on for generations to come.

It’s only taken me 30 years to figure this out. ;)

Part of me wishes I would have known earlier in life, but I am thankful God’s revealed this to me now. I’ve still got plenty of life to live!

So what do you think about the concept of a life’s mission/message/call/purpose? Is it all the same thing? Has God revealed yours by chance?
