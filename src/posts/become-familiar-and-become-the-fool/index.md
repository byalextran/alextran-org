**Pastor**: Turn your bibles to 2 Kings, Chapter 2.  
**you**: \*thinking to yourself\* That’s the story of Elijah and Elisha. I am a Bible scholar!

**Pastor**: Open up to the book of Esther.  
**you**: _**recalling**_ Oooh, good book. That’s the book before Job. Man, I’m good.

**Pastor**: Let’s start reading from Luke 2:1.  
**you**: \*turning to neighbor\* Aha! This is going to be another sermon on the birth of Jesus. Just wait and see . . .

Familiarity is a funny thing. Knowledge is too.

What happens when someone tries to talk to you about something you already know? You check out. The attitude is there is nothing you need to know. No new wisdom can be obtained.

Ever check out of a sermon? Ever read a passage in the Bible but really just skimmed it because you’re already familiar with it?

> **1 Corinthians 8:1-2 (NIV)**  
> 1 \[…\] We know that we all possess knowledge. **Knowledge puffs up**, but love builds up. 2 **The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know**.

Familiarity and knowledge are funny things. They keep us from what we “ought to know.”
