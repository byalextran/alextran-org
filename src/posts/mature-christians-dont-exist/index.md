I often hear myself comparing the behavior of Christians with that of “mature” Christians.

At this stage in my life I would call myself a mature Christian. I’ve been one for 11 years.

But mature compared to?

Other Christians.

I am diligent in maintaining my daily devotions. I’ve rid myself of all the obvious sins. I tithe and give over and above. I use my gifts to advance the Kingdom.

By those standards, when compared to other Christians, I am definitely more mature than most.

The problem is . . . that’s not the standard by which our lives are judged. Our standard is the life Jesus lived. The life God has called us to steward. Our level of obedience.

If I tithe and give over and above, that’s great. It’s easy to trick yourself into thinking your spiritual life is rock solid because you’re being more “obedient” than 95% of other Christians.

But if God has called you to extravagant giving, then you’ve failed miserably. Your maturity is that of a deceptive child.

Stop fooling yourself into thinking you’re mature.

We’re not.

P.S. This post came across rather cynical. Completely unintentional. God’s been challenging me the past couple days and this is how the post came out.

The bottom line is: seek maturity in obedience to Christ, not in comparison to others.
