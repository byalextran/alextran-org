> Acts of obedience allow our faith to intersect with God’s faithfulness. It is at that intersection that we see God work. And when we see Him work our faith gets bigger.

Ever find yourself praying for more faith?

[Pastor Stovall](http://stovallweems.com/) said something today that reminds me of my tendency to pray and wait on God.  “Waiting on God does not mean laying up on your couch with the remote (paraphrase).”

Now re-read the quote above from Andy Stanley.

There is _so_ much truth to that quote. The Bible even confirms it. ;)

> **James 4:8 (NIV)**  
> 8 Come near to God and he will come near to you. \[…\]

After we pray for more faith, how many steps of obedience have we taken?  Nada?  Zero, zilch, zippo?  Are we sitting on the couch flippin’ through the same old channels, watching the same old shows?  Re-runs suck.

Having powerless faith sucks even more.

Faith is built at the intersection of our obedience and God’s faithfulness.  God’s faithfulness to draw near to us as we draw near to him.

One step of obedience brings us two steps closer to the faith we desire.

What one step can you take today?
