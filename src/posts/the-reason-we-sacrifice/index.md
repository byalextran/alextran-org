> We give up things we love for things we love even more.

On first glance, that quote probably rings true for you. Right? You would give up \_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

It’s an easy trade when you know what you’re trading for. Especially if it’s something you know you “love even more.” What’s not easy is trading something you love now for something unknown later.

Yet that’s the exact position God often places us in.

The dream job you have now. The boyfriend/girlfriend that seems like the perfect match. The thriving ministry you’re currently leading. The comfortable life you’re living.

If God asks, trade it in for the unknown. Sacrifice it.

The hardest part for me is truly believing what’s on the other end will be something I’ll love even more than what I have now.

But the truth is that mindset is selfish.

It puts the focus on what you’re receiving rather than who you’re giving to.

> We give up things we love for things we love even more. It’s an honor to **sacrifice for Christ** and His church.
