## One Verse

![Ephesians 5:15-16 (NIV)](ephesians_5-15-16-300x186-oNy0ejp6NtrT.jpg)

## One Point

> We shouldn’t be afraid of failure.  Instead, we should be afraid of being successful at the things that don’t matter.
> 
> <cite>Unknown</cite>

Have we maximized our time?  Have we taken every opportunity God has given us?  Or have we let our days become consumed with things that don’t matter?

## One Application
