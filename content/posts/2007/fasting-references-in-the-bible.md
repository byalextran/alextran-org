I want to post the “facts” here and then make some conclusions, observations in another post. Consider it my attempt to separate church and state. ;)

So here we go . . .

### Research Methodology

I looked up all passages in the Bible (NIV) with the words [fast](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=fast&searchtype=all&wholewordsonly=yes&version1=31&spanbegin=1&spanend=73), [fasting](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=fasting&searchtype=all&wholewordsonly=yes&version1=31&spanbegin=1&spanend=73), and [fasted](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=fasted&searchtype=all&wholewordsonly=yes&version1=31&spanbegin=1&spanend=73).

Of the 85 verses found in those searches, about 65 of those actually relate to our topic of fasting. For each of the applicable verses, I read and made note of why the fast was done and anything else I found interesting.

That helped me get a much better bigger picture of fasting and why people fast.

**Disclaimer**: You really couldn’t call this a “research methodology”. I laugh at the formality of the title and the informality of the research. I don’t consider my research complete or definitive and realize there are many flaws.

But to answer my question, I think it’s a good starting point.

### Reasons people fasted in the Bible

**To repent**

*   Nehemiah 9:1-2
*   Jonah 3:5-8
*   1 Samuel 7:6
*   Daniel 9:3-4
*   Joel 2:12

**To mourn, grieve**

*   Esther 4:3
*   2 Samuel 1:12
*   Nehemiah 1:4

**To intercede for the sick**

*   Psalm 35:13
*   2 Samuel 12:15-16

**To break chains of bondage**

*   Isaiah 58:6 (the chapter overall is good and deals with fasting)

**To petition, seek answers**

*   Daniel 9:3-4
*   Ezra 8:21-23
*   Judges 20:26-28

There are some other references to fasting for other reasons, but I only wanted to hit on what I felt were the major ones.

And I don’t want you to get caught up thinking you should only fast if you find yourself in a situation categorized above.

As my next post will talk about, I don’t believe the act of fasting means anything to God. Which means I think you can fast for whatever reason as long as you have the heart of fasting.
