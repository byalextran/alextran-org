Who has been approached by a homeless guy asking for money?

And in the course of the few seconds you’re asking or thinking to yourself:

-   Does he really need the money for bus fare?
-   Am I safe? Is he going to club me over the head?
-   Is he going to use this money to buy drugs or alcohol?
-   Do I have money on me? Please don’t let me have money.

What I’ve been thinking about lately is our tendency as Christians to hesitate before taking action.

It reminded me of something a pastor once shared in Masuko, Peru on the mission field.

> **Matthew 28:18-19 (NIV)**  
> 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go . . .

“Therefore go . . . ”

Jesus’ command to us, his disciples, is _go_. Our default action as Christians should be to go.

But too often we over think and over analyze the next step or action. Paralysis through analysis. And before you know it the opportunity has passed.

If we would be less hesitant and more inclined to just jump out of the boat we would see God do more in our lives!

-   More lives getting touched with the love of Christ

The list of thoughts/hesitations I gave earlier about the homeless guy. Who cares!? Jesus makes it blatantly clear that we are supposed to help people in need and not judge them. Give the guy some money; buy him a cheeseburger. Pray with him at the very least!

That one simple act will go a lot further than you walking away rationalizing to yourself that the homeless guy was going to buy alcohol with your money.

-   More personal growth, Spiritual maturity and progress

We’ve got dreams. We’ve got God’s calling we’d all love to fulfill. We’ve got big decisions. What’s the next step? How am I going to make it happen? Where’s the money or the time going to come from?

The answer to that question can be “I don’t know.”

> ~ from [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html)

As Christians we need to be okay moving forward and taking a step without all the answers or even direct confirmation from God. The bottom line is that if you are moving forward, you are making progress.

You, walking towards your calling and dreams, will have a greater impact on people than you standing there waiting to see how God is going to align the stars to make it happen.

Therefore go.
