title: 88% of Jesus&#8217; Standard?

![88-percent](88-percent-300x214-tL7u0AtjTaIl.jpg)I’ve been marinating on this verse the past week or so:

> **Romans 6:17 (ESV)**  
> 17 But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,

Particularly, the words: _obedience_, _standard of teaching_ and _commitment_.

Our level of obedience and commitment follow our standard of teaching.

For example, what does the word “planted” mean to you in this verse?

> **Psalm 92:13 (NIV)**  
> 13 planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

How much planting do you have to do in order to flourish?

Does planted mean you attend church when you can? Or does it mean you’re at church every time there’s a service? Or maybe it means you actively serve in the church, attend a small group, take part in events _and_ go on mission trips?

As Christ-followers, we have been entrusted with the standard of Jesus Christ.

> **John 13:15 (NIV)**  
> 15 I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.

But, just as the verse in Psalm 92 above shows, that standard can mean lots of different things.

So I’ve been asking myself.

What does it mean to me? Does my current level of obedience and commitment to Jesus Christ truly reflect the standard Jesus gave me?
