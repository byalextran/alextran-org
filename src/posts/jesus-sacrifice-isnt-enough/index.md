Today’s song of the day is [Undignified](http://tinysong.com/nVH5) by The David Crowder Band.

> **1 Samuel 6:21-22 (NIV)**  
> 21 … I will celebrate before the LORD. 22 I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. …

In King David’s own words, “I will be humiliated in my own eyes.” In my own personal translation of that, “I just don’t care.” I just don’t care what the world thinks.

Have you ever thought about what Jesus has done for you? What reasons you have to “celebrate before the Lord?”

It’s crazy to think about all the things God has done for each one of us, yet our lives don’t reflect that goodness. Instead, **our lives may unknowingly tell God what he has done for us is not enough**; not enough to overcome being self-conscious about what the world thinks.

> **Matthew 13:44-46 (NIV)**  
> 44 “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

> 45 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 46 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

What we have to celebrate before the Lord should be as compelling as the treasure/pearl in the parables above. We should look at our lives and be overflowing with joy, gratitude, love, etc. for what Jesus has done for us.

It should compel us to want to live lives that are “even more undignified than this.”

That joy should be so compelling that we just don’t care what the world thinks. We want to tell about it from the rooftops; to everyone we see. We wouldn’t be afraid to pray for someone in need in the middle of a community pool. We wouldn’t be afraid to jump up and down during worship in celebration of the goodness of God. We wouldn’t care what our friends or family think about how much we love Jesus.

But why are we afraid?

I love Jesus. But why do I sometimes still look around to see what the world thinks?
