Sometimes it’s weird thinking we are God’s answer to someone’s prayer. The person receiving the answered prayer knows it’s from God without hesitation.  But often times we’re standing there scratching our head.  There was nothing spiritual about giving a friend in tough financial times $40.  Or calling a friend you hadn’t talked with in awhile just to see how they were doing.

For our personal prayers, do we subconsciously look for an answer/outcome that comes directly from God?  An obvious “miracle” or burning bush moment?

Throughout the history of the world, it’s important to remember God has chosen _people_ to execute and carry out His plans.

With that in mind, how many people in your life are answering your prayers? How many answered prayers are we overlooking?
