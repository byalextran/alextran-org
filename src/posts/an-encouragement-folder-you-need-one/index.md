> **1 Samuel 30:6 (ESV)**  
> And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But _David strengthened himself in the LORD_ his God.

I read [a great, practical tip from Ron Edmonson](http://www.ronedmondson.com/2011/10/the-encouragement-folder-every-leader-needs-one.html) this past week. It reminded me of this verse in 1 Samuel.

In Ron’s post, he suggests keeping an “encouragement folder.” A folder of notes, letters, emails, etc. that:

-   …say you’ve done something right.
-   …say you know what you are doing.
-   …say you made a difference in someone’s life.

Inevitably, we’ll find ourselves feeling much like King David: greatly distressed. For those times, I love the idea of an encouragement folder.

Assuming you have one. If not, better get on that. ;)

It is one tool you can use to encourage/strengthen yourself when you’re feeling down in the dumps.

I would also recommend keeping track of any God-milestones (significant/noteworthy things God’s done in your life).

Then, not only can your encouragement folder be a reminder of how you’ve touched other people’s lives/what you’re doing right, but also be a reminder of all that God’s done in your life.

So, what’s been encouraging you lately? And who can you encourage this week?
