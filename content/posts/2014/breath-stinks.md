Ever have one of those moments where you're blindsided? Left to pick your mouth up off the floor?

I was having a conversation with a friend the other day. This dude or dudette (gotta protect the innocent!) had three things they wanted to share with me. One and two were no biggie. But then three comes along.

"Your breath stinks."

#likewhoa

The thing with bad breath is you can never tell on your own. Try cupping your hands over your mouth and breath like Darth Vader. Yeah, it's pointless sniffing your own breath. It smells "normal" to me. The thing about us humans is we tend to think everything we do is rainbows and unicorns.

You _need_ friends that will tell you your breath stinks.

We all have blind spots. And without friends willing to speak up and share what those are with us, we will always operate blind. Often to the detriment of ourselves and those around us. (Sorry if I've breathed around you recently.)

> **Proverbs 27:6**
> Wounds from a friend can be trusted…

The challenge is not waiting for someone to drop a #likewhoa moment on you, but intentionally seeking it out yourself.

I triple dog dare you to ask a close friend if you have any blind spots. Blind spots that may be affecting your relationship with God, your relationship with others (spouse, friends, family, co-workers, etc.) or possibly even things unknowingly hurting yourself.

This requires a willingness to be humble and vulnerable.

If you've had these types of conversations before, will you be vulnerable and share in the comments some blind spots you've had brought to your attention?
