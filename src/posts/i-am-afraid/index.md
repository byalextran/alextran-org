I don’t know why, but I’m afraid.

I’m afraid of responsibility.

I’m afraid of leading people.

I’m afraid of being outwardly passionate.

I’m afraid of accepting the authority given to me.

I’m afraid of stepping up my game.

I’m afraid of my life being out of balance.

I’m afraid.

I’m paralyzed.

> **2 Corinthians 11:30 (NIV)**  
> 30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

> **2 Corinthians 12:10 (NIV)**  
> 10 That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

> **2 Corinthians 13:4 (NIV)**  
> 4 For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him to serve you.

But I will learn to walk again by God’s power . . .
