title: Don't Be Afraid to Ask
description: Don't be afraid to ask God for things. Doesn't matter if you deserve it or not. What rookie mistake you made last week. Or how close to God you feel.

My church kicks off [Awakening](http://www.awake21.org/): 21 Days of Prayer, Fasting and Personal Devotion today. Miraculously, I rolled myself out of bed at 6 AM to catch the first session of the Virtual Conference.

Afterward, as I began to worship, I was overwhelmed by God’s goodness and was reminded of this verse.

> **Matthew 7:7-11 (ESV)**
> 7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 11 _If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!_

Particularly the emphasized part.

I don’t know about you, but it’s kind of been a tiring season for me. And I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t always been on point spending time with God and fanning the flame of devotion.

Which is why I was overwhelmed by God’s goodness today.

Despite me withdrawing from God at times, I still see his hand at work in my life. I still see the blessings and constant reminders of how he cares for his children.

In times like these (Foo Fighters anyone?), it’s natural for us to disengage from God when we know we’re not where we should be in our relationship with Him. How many of you agree when you feel disconnected from God it’s also hard to ask God for something?

Which makes Awakening awkward because every year during this time I always highlight two or three things I want to pray and ask God for.

But that’s why this verse is so great as I kick off the fast because it reminds me (all of us!) not be afraid to ask God even if we feel far from God. We’re “evil.” We do stupid things. We sin. But we are still his children and he will “give good things to those who ask!”

So if you happen to be joining me in Awakening, let’s ask and believe God boldly!

It doesn’t matter if you deserve it or not. What rookie mistake you made last week. Or how close to God you feel right now.

Don’t be afraid to ask.

If you’re comfortable sharing, I would love to hear in the comments what two or three things you’re praying/believing God for so I can be in agreement with you!
