description: A collection of the most popular Bible verses suitable for weekly Scripture memory.

One of the road blocks I've hit when it comes to memorizing Bible verses is coming up with which verses to memorize. Sure, I usually have a couple verses at any given time that are meaningful to me, so those are a great starting point. But after that, I usually draw a blank and then quit. ;)

To not let that happen anymore, I decided to compile a list of memory verses.

Now whenever I need a verse to memorize, I can skim through this collection and see which I want to use.

So whenever you're looking for the next weekly memory verse, just hit up one of these sites!

### [Fighter Verses](https://www.fighterverses.com)

> The Fighter Verses focus on:
>
> 1.  the character and worth of our great God
> 2.  battling against our fleshly desires
> 3.  the hope of the Gospel

This is the jackpot of all things Scripture memory. Here you'll find a collection of 260 verses (one every week for five years). Each verse is categorized so you can target memory verses based on cool stuff like God's faithfulness, being patient, battling temptation, etc.

Not only that but they have an iPhone/Android app you can use to review and quiz yourself on the verses.

I told you it was the jackpot. ;)

### Final Words

I leave you with some final words from [John Piper and others](http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/taste-see-articles/why-memorize-scripture) who have spent a lifetime mediating on God's Word.

> Bible memorization is absolutely fundamental to spiritual formation. If I had to choose between all the disciplines of the spiritual life, I would choose Bible memorization, because it is a fundamental way of filling our minds with what it needs.
> ~Dallas Willard

> I know of no other single practice in the Christian life more rewarding, practically speaking, than memorizing Scripture. . . . No other single exercise pays greater spiritual dividends! Your prayer life will be strengthened. Your witnessing will be sharper and much more effective. Your attitudes and outlook will begin to change. Your mind will become alert and observant. Your confidence and assurance will be enhanced. Your faith will be solidified.
> ~Chuck Swindoll

> If we would be changed into Christ likeness we must steadily see him. This happens in the word. […] Bible memorization has the effect of making our gaze on Jesus steadier and clearer.
> ~John Piper
