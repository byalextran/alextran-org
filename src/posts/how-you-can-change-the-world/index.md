Do you truly believe you can change the world? What is your definition of changing the world?

My current definition (in progress) is: impacting eternity through being used by God.

I’ve fallen into the trap that in order to change the world, you have to influence millions. If that’s the case, most of us are screwed. We’re not going to influence millions in our lifetime.

But if you look through the Bible, there are countless stories of ordinary people changing the course of history. Moses, King David, Esther, Nehemiah, Paul, Peter, etc.

What do they all have in common? I feel like Exodus 31:1-3 sums it up nicely.

> **Exodus 31:1-3 (NIV)**  
> 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, 2 “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills . . .

This passage shows Bezalel was:

-   Chosen by God
-   Filled with the Spirit of God
-   Given wisdom, understanding, knowledge and skills

Anybody who acknowledges these three things in their own lives can change the world.

Bezalel was an artist; a designer; a craftsmen. His wisdom, understanding, knowledge and skills aided his ability to build the tabernacle according to God’s requirements.

All of us have been given similar wisdom, understanding, knowledge and skills (cf. 1 Peter 4:10).

The difference between changing the world or not is how we use those skills.

Bezalel could have used all his abilities to design/build incredible artwork for others. Being as gifted as he was, I bet he could have made a great living and been well-known for it. But eternity would not have been impacted by a few pieces of furniture, artwork or buildings.

The work of God is always to impact eternity.

Only when we allow ourselves be used for God’s work will we be able to impact eternity.

Changing the world doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be an evangelist getting thousands saved at once. Or that you have to write a timeless devotional read for generations to come.

It simply means you know:

-   You’re chosen by God
-   You’ve been filled with the Spirit of God
-   You’ve been given wisdom, understanding, knowledge and skills

And you’re willing to let God use you.

What unique gift-mix has God given you to impact eternity?

For me, I believe one of the main (if not the main) area is investing in the lives of others.

It may sound funny, but this blog is part of that. I started it cause I believe God has wired me uniquely to be a blogger at heart. ;) When I write, I pour out what God has poured into me in hopes that it would challenge/encourage you towards a deeper, fuller relationship with Christ.

Thanks to the Internet, I hope when I die these words will continue to exist and impact others.
