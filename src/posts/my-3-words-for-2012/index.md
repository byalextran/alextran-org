Following the [footsteps of Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/3words2012/), I’ve come up with 3 words instead of resolutions for the new year.

Rather than resolutions which tend to focus on a specific areas, these words represent broader themes that will help me define my goals and experiences for 2012.

Here are my three words for the year.

### Explore

This is a word that is completely opposite of my natural tendencies. I don’t explore. I don’t get outside my comfort zone.

But this year I want to get off the couch/Internet and explore the diverseness of life. Create new memories, experience new sights and entertain new hobbies.

### Rise

Not too long ago I asked a handful of people some feedback questions. One question was “What could I improve?”

This was the common thread.

> I honestly feel like there is so much more to you then you ever let out.

> You have a lot to offer. Sometimes it seems like you hold back…

It’s all true. And I don’t know why. Why I tend to shrink back. Not rise to my potential. Why I hide from embracing leadership responsibilities.

So the word “rise” is a charge to rise to my potential. Be on the offensive. Attack rather than retreat. Embrace the fear.

### Discipline

There are a lot of things I’d like to do in 2012. Explore life, rise to my potential, write two ebooks, develop a useful web app, etc.

All that requires discipline. The discipline to start, follow-through and finish. The discipline to show up every day regardless of feeling or motivation.

How about you? What words will be driving themes for you in 2012?
