- a disciple of Jesus Christ

### A Disciple of Jesus Christ

I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ in my dorm room, at my computer, and with the door wide open. I was a sophomore in college.

> **Luke 14:28, 33 (NIV)** 28 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? \[...\] 33 In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.

But it wasn't until early 2005 that I took the time to "estimate the cost" of my commitment to Jesus. From there on out, I wasn't content with giving just my free time, but my entire life.

I no longer wanted to execute the plan I had laid out. I wanted to execute the plan God had laid out.

Thus I've been in full-time church ministry since 2005. The first six years at [Celebration Church](http://www.celebration.org/) and currently at [Life.Church](https://www.life.church).

### An Introverted People Person

My heart is ministry. It is to serve God and bring people closer to Him with everything he has blessed me with (2 Corinthians 3:5; 1 Peter 4:10).

One gift that God has given me is the ability to be able to sit in front of a computer for 40 hours a week. That puts me squarely in the "geek" and introverted classification. ;)

### A Computer Programmer by Education

I went to college at [Case Western Reserve University](http://www.case.edu). Got my B.S. in Computer Engineering. And no, that doesn't mean I went to college to learn how to fix your computer. ;)
