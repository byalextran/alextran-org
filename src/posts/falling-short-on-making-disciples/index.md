> **Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)**  
> 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. \[…\]

You know this verse if you’ve been a Christian for any period of time. Along with Matthew 22:36-40 ,this is probably one of the most significant commands Jesus ever gave us.

Because of its significance, it’s worth marinating on. Are we fulfilling it?

It’s important to note the Great Commission was given to individuals. Not to the church.

Jesus asked us (individually) to go and make disciples.

1.  How many people pursue God more because they’ve seen you passionately pursue God?
2.  How many trust God more because they’ve seen you trust God in _all_ seasons of your life?
3.  How many people are comfortable in prayer/worship outside of church because they’ve done it at your house multiple times before?

If we are not teaching people to walk out the Word of God, we are not making disciples.

Are we failing miserably?

I feel like I am.
