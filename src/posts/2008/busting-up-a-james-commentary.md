[![The Letter of James (book cover)](images/letter-of-james-150x150-b4reWZfmQMcV.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802837301/102-4539131-4019337?ie=UTF8&tag=shr-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0802837301 "The Letter of James by Douglas J. Moo (amazon.com)")This past week I decided to “bust up” a commentary on the book of James. Don’t ask me what “to bust up” means. Ask [Mike Doughty](http://www.mikedoughty.com/). He’s the one who wrote “[Busting Up A Starbucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhRWoWpCjjM).”

But anyway.

For however many posts it’ll take, I’m going to synthesize what I read into a series of digestible blog posts.

Both as an effort to make me learn the material better and also to increase your James IQ. Each blog post can be viewed as a CliffsNotes (did you know it’s actually [CliffsNotes](http://www.cliffsnotes.com/) and not Cliff Notes?) version of the section I’m reading.

The commentary I chose was written by my boy Douglas J. Moo. I chose it because of the [high number of positive reviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802837301/102-4539131-4019337?ie=UTF8&tag=shr-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0802837301) on Amazon.com and because I know Moo is a very well respected New Testament scholar.

That’s why he’s my boy.

DJ Moo and A-Tran tag-teaming to bring you the best of James. ;)
