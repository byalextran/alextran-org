…and soak up these lyrics.

In the midst of madness, chaos and life, sometimes we just need to slow down and sit at the feet of Jesus.

And let him remind us of this…

### The More I Seek You (Kari Jobe)

```
The more I seek you,
the more I find you.
The more I find you,
the more I love you

I wanna sit at your feet,
drink from the cup in your hand.
Lay back against you and breath,
feel your heart beat

This love is so deep,
it's more than I can stand.
I melt in your peace,
it's overwhelming
```
