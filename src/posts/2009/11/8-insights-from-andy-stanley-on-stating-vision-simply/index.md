Last night I listened to the latest episode of Andy Stanley’s Leadership Podcast ([iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=290055666), [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndyStanleyLeadershipPodcast)) titled _Stating Vision Simply_. It fit well with another article I read from Joel on Software called [_Figuring out what your company is all about_](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/11/01.html).

I’ve decided I like Andy Stanley. ;) And I always knew I liked what Joel had to say on software. ;)

Here are some of the notes I typed out. Some are quotes, some are paraphrases.

### Notes from Stating Vision Simply

-   Andy’s working definition of vision is “a mental picture of what could be . . . fueled by a passion that it should be.”

-   In order to accomplish at home what I wanted to accomplish at home that meant there were some things I might not be able to accomplish at work.
    -   Vision pre-decides for us.
    -   The clearer our vision gets, the fewer things we do and the easier it is to say no.

-   It’s gotta be simple, it’s gotta be portable, it’s gotta be repeatable.

-   It has to be transferable. Memorable is portable.

-   To make your vision simple, it can’t be complete. Complete is not memorable or transferable.

As reinforcement to crafting a simple vision statement, Andy asked what Barack Obama’s vision for his presidential campaign was? What was Hillary Clinton’s? John McCain’s?

Point taken. I knew Obama’s was “Change.” Couldn’t tell you what anybody else’s was. ;)

-   The larger the audience, the simpler it has to be. Every time you add a layer,  you have to add another layer of simplicity.

-   If you’re beginning with a fog, the best you’re going to communicate is a mist.
    -   Before you can make vision stick, you have to have a clear vision yourself.

> If it’s a mist in the pulpit, it’s a fog in the pew.
> ~Howard Hendricks

-   If you say everything, you say nothing. It’s not portable.

### Portable and Memorable Vision Statements

To make poverty history (Bono’s [ONE](http://www.one.org/) campaign).

Invest and invite ([North Point’s](http://www.northpoint.org/) evangelism strategy).

To create a church unchurched people love to attend (One of North Point’s early vision statements).

Help your users be awesome (the mantra of [Kathy Sierra](http://headrush.typepad.com/)).

We help the world’s best developers make better software (the new tagline for [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/)).

### My Personal Takeaway

From the podcast, I take away “Make it memorable. Make it portable.”

Also to take the time to get a clear vision. The quote from Howard Hendricks resonates with me.

It is worth the initial effort to determine a clear vision for yourself. Otherwise, you will inevitably waste time in the future doing things that are not getting you where you want to go.
