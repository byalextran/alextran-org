As I’ve been reading through the Psalms lately, there’s been a major theme I’ve noticed.

Many start off with a less-than-ideal circumstance; enemies surround me, wicked prospering while the righteous struggle, prayers falling on deaf ears, etc., but they inevitably end with a declaration of trust in God.

I love the Psalms for their transparency. They are a realistic portrayal of what it’s like to live as a Christian desiring after God’s heart.

The Psalmists do an amazing job of expressing that peace and trust despite the circumstances that surround them.

> **Psalm 55 (NIV)**
> \[…\]
> 2 My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
> 3 because of what my enemy is saying,
> because of the threats of the wicked;
> for they bring down suffering on me
> and assail me in their anger.
> 4 My heart is in anguish within me;
> the terrors of death have fallen on me.
> 5 Fear and trembling have beset me;
> horror has overwhelmed me.
> \[…\]
> 16 As for me, I call to God,
> and _the LORD saves me_.
> 17 Evening, morning and noon
> I cry out in distress,
> and _he hears my voice_.
> 18 _He rescues me unharmed_
> from the battle waged against me,
> even though many oppose me.
> \[…\]
> 22 Cast your cares on the LORD
> and _he will sustain you_;
> _he will never let
> the righteous be shaken_.
> 23 \[…\]
> _**But as for me, I trust in you**_.

You’ll notice the first part of this Psalm explains the situation. It’s pretty bad. Sounds like the Psalmist is on the verge of breaking.

But it ends with a simple, yet powerful phrase. “But as for me, I trust in you.” It is that trust, I’m confident, provides the peace to live in a troubled world (John 16:33).

Never be afraid to have a realistic view of your current situation; no matter how good or bad. But also never forget to have a realistic expectation of the God we serve.

According to this Psalm, we serve a God that saves us, hears us, rescues us, sustains us and never lets us be shaken.

But as for me, I trust in you.
