I can encourage people. I can challenge people. I spend time with God daily. I’m comfortable praying out loud. I can give advice and guidance.

In essence, I am a leader. I can do things that leaders do.

I can talk the talk.

I realized this today in a small group I am attending. I can read, extract practical application, and talk about the areas that God is “challenging me in.” It all sounds good. Makes me look like I have my spiritual life under control.

But am I doing anything with that talk?

The answer is no. Don’t deceive yourself Alex.

> **James 1:22-24 (NIV)**  
> 22 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.

**Disclaimer**: I’m not off the deep end. This is not a post confessing I have been a deceptive leader. God is just challenging me to the next level of leadership. One that I have yet to answer because I have been deceiving myself.

Consider this a light bulb moment post.

A moment where you realize what God desires from you will actually require some action. More commitment. More drive. More humility.

A moment where you realize what God desires is actually worth the sacrifice.
