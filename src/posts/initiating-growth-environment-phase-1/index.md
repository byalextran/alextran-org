This is a follow-up to my [last post](https://www.alextran.org/2008/04/14/creating-an-atmosphere-of-growth/) talking about ways to ensure continual spiritual growth. In the post, I talked about some big bucket areas that I wanted to check on monthly to ensure I was growing in them.

Along with those buckets, I wanted to look up some memory verses as reference points for my actions during the month.

Here are the buckets/verses I came up with.

### Reading/meditating/memorizing the Bible

As I mature in my faith and understanding of God, it’s become more apparent how critical it is that I \_saturate\_ myself in the Word of God. I’m getting to the point where I feel like it needs to be my #1 spiritual discipline.

I mean, it’s the stinkin’ Word of God in written form. Where else is God’s wisdom, advice and direction going to be more clear? It doesn’t get more burning bush than “Love God, love your neighbor.” Seriously. ;)

> **Deuteronomy 10:12-13 (NIV)**  
> 12 And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 13 and to observe the LORD’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?

### Interceding for others

I have a tendency to pray for my issues and my needs \_way\_ too much. Last I checked, there was only one me and billions of other people. To be fair, it seems like I should probably pray for some of those billions of people a little bit more than I have. ;)

> **1 Timothy 2:1 (NIV)**  
> 1 I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone

### Ability to love people and demonstrate that love

Greatest Commandment (Matthew 22:34-40; Mark 12:28-34) anybody? We have always got to be growing in our love for God and other people.

> **Romans 13:8 (NIV)**  
> 8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.

### Engaging others about Jesus

I live in a bubble. A gimongous, Christian bubble. It’s time to pop that bubble and get dirty. <– period.

> **Luke 5:32 (NIV)**  
> 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

### Confessing sins

This was added after my initial list because it needs to happen. I need to continually be broken before Jesus about all the stuff I’m screwing up.

> **1 John 1:9 (NIV)**  
> 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
