Awhile back I took a look at the different options for maintaining multiple [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blogs with a single install in order to streamline WordPress and plugin updates. I looked at pretty much all the options on [this Codex page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_Multiple_Blogs) and only one stood out.

In fact, it was head and shoulders above all the other ones.

So I introduce you to Stephen Rider’s [Virtual Multiblog](http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/virtual-multiblog/) based on Allan Mertner’s [original idea](http://www.mertner.com/allan/index.php?p=15).

It currently powers [stovallweems.com](http://stovallweems.com), [kerriweems.com](http://kerriweems.com), [shineinc.org](http://www.shineinc.org), and [awake08.com](http://www.awake21.org).

Please check it out. I love the elegance in it’s implementation!
