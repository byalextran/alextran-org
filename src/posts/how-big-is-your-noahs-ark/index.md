Learning from your past experiences is a great thing to do. But using your past experiences as a gauge for what God can do in the future is a horrible idea.

Often a smart thing to do is [not so smart when it comes to God](https://www.alextran.org/2011/01/14/a-story-about-minimal-mannie/). In fact, it puts a lid on God and becomes the limiting factor in what God can do in your life.

As an example, let’s talk about Noah and the ark. God asked Noah to build an ark in order to preserve himself, his family and some animals.

Based on past experiences this is what Noah had to go off of.

-   God had never wiped everyone off the earth before.
-   This level of flooding had never been experienced before.
-   Nobody had ever built an ark of that size.

If I were Noah, I’d be thinking to myself God is crazy. Nothing of this magnitude has ever been done before. And right there, our realism, the wisdom of past experiences will fail us.

It fails us because we’ve limited what God can do.What God has _not_ done in your life does not mean he can’t or won’t.

Don’t put a lid on him by looking at your past experiences and have them dictate your level of faith in God.

If you’re believing God for a restored marriage, don’t look at how many times you’ve tried to reconcile and failed. Don’t look at the repeated unwillingness of your spouse to go to counseling. If you’re believing God for a job, don’t look at how many resumes you’ve submitted and not heard back from.

What if Noah were the Realistic Reggie type?

Based on past experience, he would have built a little life boat instead of an ark (if that even). Flood? Hah, never seen one before. Giant ark? Have you ever seen me pick up a hammer?

What has God called you to? What is his vision for your life? What are you believing for?

> **Ephesians 3:20-21 (ESV)**  
> 20 Now to _him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think_, according to the power at work within us, 21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

Do you want God to do far more abundantly than all you can ask or think in a life boat or an ark big enough to preserve every living creature on earth?

Create space for God. Give him room to fill.

Go. Build an “ark” for God.

And share with everyone in the comments how you’re going to do it. I welcome all tips/insight/wisdom cause it’s definitely a lot easier said than done. ;)
