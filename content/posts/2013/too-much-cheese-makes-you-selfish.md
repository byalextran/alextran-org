Occasionally I pray for a miraculous supply of never ending cheese. I know God's done it before with flour and oil (1 Kings 17:14), so why not cheese?

Or, how about garlic bread made with Texas toast? And when I'm feeling extra bold and full of faith, I pray for all-you-can-eat filet mignon. Is that too much to ask for God!?

That would for be the life for sure.

I never hesitate to eat a heaping portion of cheese whenever there's an opportunity. But why is it that I fail to seize every opportunity God gives me to demonstrate his love to others, be obedient to His word and follow through on conviction from the Holy Spirit?

Just a few weeks ago a random, flamboyantly gay guy (Jeremy) comes crashing a dinner party with some friends of mine. We're outside eating by the fire pit when he comes stumbling by drunk and high. It's pretty obvious Jeremy's fully committed to staying, so I say a few polite things to him but essentially ignore him the rest of the night.

In my mind, I'm thinking I'm tired; I'm ready to go home. This is my safe place among friends. My ministry/pastor hat is off. Let me just enjoy a night relaxing before the long Sunday ahead.

I even handed him an invite card to church. What more do you want from me God?

A lot more.

Here is a kid that is lost and caught up in a world of sin that will only lead to death (James 1:15). Standing next to a pastor who knows the love of Christ and has seen his redemptive power firsthand but didn't do anything about it.

I ate the cheese.

My selfishness brought about immediate satisfaction at the expense of Jeremy's eternal salvation.

Everyday is a limitless supply of selfish opportunities _and_ God opportunities. Don't be selfish. ([click to tweet](http://clicktotweet.com/reyve).)

Choose to be the light and love of Christ in a world that so desperately needs it.

**What helps you be less selfish? Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.**
