> **Nehemiah 2:12 (NIV)
> **…I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem.

A word from God changes everything.

When God places a burden on your heart, no other burden matters.

You have the perspective, perseverance and courage you need to walk that call out.

But so often we don’t bother asking God what his heart is for us and then we have no perspective, no perseverance and no courage.

What situation or problem are you facing now? Have you asked God what his heart is for you?

You will need that spiritual burden to succeed. When we don’t have that spiritual burden, we get easily weighed down by emotional, mental and physical burdens. We hit eject too early. We wander aimlessly. We achieve nothing of value. All while the life and energy gets sucked out of us.

And, ultimately, we miss out on not just what God wants to teach us, but what he wants to do through us.

A spiritual burden allows you to look out on a hopeless situation, just as Nehemiah did…

> **Nehemiah 1:17 (NIV)**
> Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire.

…and know you can succeed.

> **Nehemiah 1:20 (NIV)**
> I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding…

Pray. Ask. Succeed.

If God calls you, he will also equip you.

It’s always easier to persevere when we know we’re on the path God has called us to. How have you seen that ring true in your life? Share with me in the comments, por favor!
